            <h2>1. Hand Hygiene</h2>
            <p>
                Wash your hands regularly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially before eating, after using the bathroom, and after coughing or sneezing. If soap and water are unavailable, use a hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Proper hand hygiene reduces the risk of spreading infections and is one of the simplest ways to protect yourself and others from illnesses.

            <h2>2. Respiratory Hygiene</h2>
            <p>
                Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your elbow when you cough or sneeze. Dispose of tissues immediately and wash your hands. This practice helps prevent the spread of respiratory droplets, which can carry viruses and bacteria. Wearing a mask in crowded places can also reduce the risk of transmitting or contracting respiratory infections.

            <h2>3. Vaccination</h2>
            <p>
                Stay up-to-date with recommended vaccines for your age and health condition. Vaccinations protect you from serious diseases and help prevent outbreaks. Consult your healthcare provider about necessary immunizations, including flu shots, childhood vaccines, and others like the COVID-19 vaccine. Vaccination is a crucial preventive measure for maintaining public health and safety.

            <h2>4. Healthy Diet</h2>
            <p>
                Maintain a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Proper nutrition supports immune function, helps manage weight, and reduces the risk of chronic diseases. Limit intake of processed foods, sugary beverages, and excessive fats. Staying hydrated by drinking plenty of water is also essential for overall health.

            <h2>5. Regular Exercise</h2>
            <p>
                Engage in regular physical activity, such as walking, cycling, or swimming, for at least 30 minutes most days of the week. Exercise improves cardiovascular health, strengthens muscles and bones, and boosts mental well-being. It also helps in maintaining a healthy weight and reduces the risk of chronic illnesses such as heart disease and diabetes.

            <p>
                Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep per night. Adequate sleep is crucial for physical and mental health, as it helps repair and rejuvenate the body. Poor sleep can lead to weakened immunity, weight gain, and increased risk of chronic conditions. Establish a consistent sleep schedule and create a comfortable sleeping environment to improve sleep quality.

            <h2>7. Hydration</h2>
            <p>
                Drink plenty of water throughout the day to stay hydrated. Proper hydration supports bodily functions, including digestion, temperature regulation, and nutrient transport. Dehydration can lead to fatigue, headaches, and reduced cognitive function. Carry a water bottle with you and drink regularly, especially in hot weather or during physical activity.

            <p>
                Avoid smoking and limit alcohol consumption to protect your health. Smoking increases the risk of respiratory diseases, cardiovascular issues, and cancer. Excessive alcohol intake can lead to liver disease, addiction, and other health problems. If you smoke, seek help to quit, and if you drink, do so in moderation.

            <p>
                Manage stress through healthy coping mechanisms such as exercise, meditation, deep breathing, and hobbies. Chronic stress can negatively impact mental and physical health, leading to issues like anxiety, depression, and heart disease. Prioritize self-care and seek support from friends, family, or professionals when needed.

            <h2>12. Safe Medication Use</h2>
            <p>
                Follow your healthcare provider's instructions when taking medications. Do not share prescriptions, and avoid self-medicating with over-the-counter drugs. Be aware of potential side effects and interactions with other medications. Store medicines safely out of reach of children and dispose of expired or unused medications properly.
